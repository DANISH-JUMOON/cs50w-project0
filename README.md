<h1>Google Search Replica Project</h1> <br />
Overview
This project is a simple website that mimics the basic functionality of Google’s search, image search, and advanced search pages. The goal is to replicate Google’s user interface (UI) and behavior using HTML and CSS. The website consists of three pages:

Google Search (index.html)
Google Image Search
Google Advanced Search
Features
<h1>1. Google Search Page (index.html)</h1>
A centered search bar with rounded corners, consistent with Google's design.
Two buttons below the search bar:
Google Search: Takes the user to the Google search results page for the query.
I'm Feeling Lucky: Takes the user directly to the first result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
Links to the Image Search and Advanced Search pages in the upper-right corner of the page.
<h1>2. Google Image Search Page</h1>
A search bar for querying Google Images.
A button that takes the user to Google Image search results for their query.
A link in the upper-right corner to return to the Google Search page.
<h1>3. Google Advanced Search Page</h1>
Four input fields where users can:
Search for pages with all the specified words.
Search for pages with an exact word or phrase.
Search for pages with any of the listed words.
Exclude pages containing certain words.
A blue “Advanced Search” button that takes the user to the search results based on the provided inputs.
A link in the upper-right corner to return to the Google Search page.
<h1>How to Use</h1>
Google Search:
Enter a query into the search bar and click "Google Search" to see search results.
Alternatively, click "I'm Feeling Lucky" to go directly to the first result.
Image Search:
Enter a query and click the "Image Search" button to be taken to the image search results.
Advanced Search:
Fill in any of the four search criteria fields.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
HTML5
CSS3 (to style the pages to look similar to Google’s aesthetic)
Forms and GET method: For submitting user queries to Google’s search engine.
<h1>Notes</h1>
You may encounter a redirect notice when clicking the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. This is normal and is due to Google’s security features.
The CSS has been written to resemble Google’s own styling as closely as possible.
